MAGs-pipeline

This website contains the MAG construction pipeline for RMGMC Metagenome Project.
Including:
(1) Reads quality control and low-quality reads timming

(2) metagenome assembly using two tools

(3) merge multiple sources of assembles

(4) SNP, Indels correction by re-sequencing methods

(5) MAGs construction by metabat2, maxbin and concoct

(6) Integrating MAGs by DAStools 

(7) MAGs quality control and dereplication

(8) Taxonomy identification

(9) maximum-likelihood tree construction based on MAGs
